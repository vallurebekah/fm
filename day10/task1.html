                By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                
                An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                A visited link is underlined and purple
                An active link is underlined and red

            <dt>BLOCK LEVEL & INLINE ELEMENTS</dt>
            <dd>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
                A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
                 Two commonly used block elements are: p and div.</dd>
            <dd>An inline element does not start on a new line.
                An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
