        <summary>Panner pulav</summary>
        While there are many delicious Indian Paneer pulav made with cottage cheese, this paneer gravy recipe is one of my favorites. The addition of onion paste and the special spice blend make this paneer curry recipe quite different from others.<br>
        You may have encountered a similar style of paneer pulav in Indian restaurants; sometimes youâ€™ll see it made with potatoes and peas in addition to paneer.
